Learning to use GitHub

When I finished my schooling I couldn't find a job programming so I worked out of my field. Now I am 
trying to return to software development and find myself lacking in some essential skills it seems.
I am working through CodeBat to bring my mind back into shape with programming using Java. 
I would really like to expand my knowledge of programming in other languages as well.
